# ü•∏ Project philosophy
Energy should be made readily accesible to everyone - There are numerous mega-trends shaping our world as we know it.
One of them is the prevalence of
portable (think smart phones & tables) and wearables (think fitness trackers and smart watches) devices.
According to ‚Äúwww.statista.com‚Äù, there were 136 million wearables shipped in the USA from 2016 ‚Äì 2018.
Furthermore, for 2018, the worldwide market for wireless charging in wearable technology is projected
to grow to 940 million US dollars.
While these gadgets have numerous benefits and offer countless functions, they have one main limitation
‚Äì the need for continuous electrical energy. Without which, these devices are nothing more than an
expensive, high tech paper weight. Typically, the more functions the device performs and the higher the
usage, the more energy is used and therefore, the more frequently the battery that stores the electrical
energy needs to be topped-up. Over time, due to degradation in the material the battery is constructed
from, the performance (i.e., the ability for it to retain charge) decreases. Consequently, topping-up needs
to be done more frequently. From observation, people tend to have routines where they plug in devices
multiple times per day as necessary to keep them charged. Over the last couple of years, there have been
some innovation to allow these devices to be charged by simply placing them on a charging MAT (AKA:
Contact charging). The problem there is that contact is required for the process to work.
What if your wearable device could automatically charge if it is within range (a few feet) of a power
transmitter ‚Äì similar to how your portable or smart devices automatically connects to a router (Wi-Fi)
once it is in range?
That would eliminate the tedious and time-consuming task of needing to plug in these devices! Moreover,
you could use the time saved for other things.

Goals for the project achieved
- Convert the RF energy transmitted by a Wi-Fi router into usable energy to charge or directly power
a low power consumption device.
- Make the energy conversion process efficient
- Ideally implement the design to occupy the smallest space (volume) possible, however proof of concept is required first
- Documentation and testing of a working prototype that meets the technical and functional
specifications
